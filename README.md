# Yumorithm

An Algorithm is an explicit, precise, unambiguous mechanically-executable
sequence of elementary instructions, usually intended to accomplish
a specific purpose.

**Yumorithm** is a collection of algorithms that are implemented in Rust (for educational purposes).

## Implemented algorithms

Currently, we have developed the following data structures and algorithms:

- [Search Algorithms](https://github.com/YumcoderCom/yumorithm/tree/main/src/searching)
- [ ] Sorting
- [ ] Data Structures
- [ ] Dynamic Programming
- [ ] Graph
- [ ] Math
- [ ] String
- [ ] Cipher
- [ ] Hash
- [ ] Geometry
- [ ] Data base and cache
- [ ] Consensus algorithm
- [ ] Distributed global unique ID generation
