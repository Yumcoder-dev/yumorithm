# Yumorithm

An Algorithm is an explicit, precise, unambiguous mechanically-executable
sequence of elementary instructions, usually intended to accomplish
a specific purpose.
**Yumorithm** is a collection of algorithms implemented in Rust.

## Implemented algorithms

Currently, we have developed the following data structures and algorithms:
